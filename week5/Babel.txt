What is Babel.js ?
Babel is a essentially an ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5 transpiler.
ESNext to ES”current” transpiler. 
Babeljs is a configurable transpiler, a compiler which translates from Javascript to Javascript unlike a compiler which translates high level application code into lower level code or binaries. 
In short - it allows you to use language features “from the future”.
It does so by transpiling your code to the currently supported version of JavaScript.

ex:
let myFunc = () => {
    console.log("ES6 is awesome!");
};

the function above would get compiled to:

var myFunc = function() {
    console.log("ES6 is awesome!");
};
