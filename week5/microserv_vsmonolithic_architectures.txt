  Monolithic vs Microservice Architecture

> Monolithic Architecture :---
 What is Monolithic ?
  Monolithic means composed all in one piece i.e. code components are interconnected and interdependent.
  For example,consider MVC, when a web client (browser) sends a request, the following happens:
               The business layer performs the business logic.
               Data access layer performs database collects/stores specific tasks.
               Presentation layer shows the data to the user.
         This actually same code maintains all the code (presentation, business and data access layer).     
 >>>> Benefits of Monolithic Architecture:
  >>Complexity
  >>Deployability
  >>Testing
  >>Handling Failure

> Microservice Architecture
In general,What is microservice ?
   Microservice :
                 A self-contained, well-defined, small and independently deployable unit.
                 Which does not depend on the state of other services.

This is to split application into a set of smaller, interconnected services instead of building a single monolithic application.

Each microservice is a small application that has its own architecture, consisting of business logic along with various adapters.
>>>>> Benifits of Microservice Architecture:
>>Easier to understand and maintain
>>Adopting new technologies
>>Scalable and Cost effective

Finally.............
  Microservice based architecture provides a lot of ways to handle a complex system, but have own  challenges and complexities. 
 Useful, if application is really big, complex, and does a lot of different things.
 
 In case of a simple application, monolithic architecture is a better approach.
