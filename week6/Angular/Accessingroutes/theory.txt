Routes tell the router which view to display when a user clicks a link or pastes a URL into the browser address bar.

A typical Angular Route has two properties:

path: a string that matches the URL in the browser address bar.
component: the component that the router should create when navigating to this route.
also some other like:
pathmatch:full,...
redirectTo:component name,

RouterModule.forRoot():

You first must initialize the router and start it listening for browser location changes.

Add RouterModule to the @NgModule.imports array and configure it with the routes in one step by calling RouterModule.forRoot() within the imports array, like this:

imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(routes) ],

Add RouterOutlet:-
The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule.

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

Add a navigation link (routerLink):

Users shouldn't have to paste a route URL into the address bar. They should be able to click a link to navigate.
