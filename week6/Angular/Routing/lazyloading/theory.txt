What is LAZY LOADING ?
Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated. 
This can add some initial performance during the initial load, especially if you have many components with complex routing
ex:
in youtube,soon after you open only video loads ,later comments,bell icons etc loaded on scrolling this is best example
for lazy loading does not display unnecessary content to user.
Loads on demand is called as lazy loading.
