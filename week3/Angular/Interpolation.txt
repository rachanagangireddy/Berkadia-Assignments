Interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into a property binding
>Here interpolation braces in {{1 + 1}} surround the template expression 1 + 1.
In the property binding section below, a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol as in [property]="expression".
Ex:.html code
<h3>
  {{title}}
  <img src="{{heroImageUrl}}" style="height:30px">
</h3>

Property Binding: to set an element property to a non-string data value, you must use property binding.
